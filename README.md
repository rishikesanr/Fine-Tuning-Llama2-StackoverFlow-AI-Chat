# Fine Tuning LLAMA 2 with Stackoverflow's AI Chat 

The LLAMA 2 model has been optimized using training data derived from StackOverflow AI assistant conversations. These assistants can provide real-time help, suggest code improvements, and answer programming-related questions, thereby increasing productivity and reducing the time spent on debugging.

A vast.ai instance was used to train this model. 

The fine tuned model is now available in my [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/rishikesanr/stack-overflow-bot-llama2).

The stackoverflow AI chat's training set can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jbrophy123/stackoverflow_dataset?row=0).
